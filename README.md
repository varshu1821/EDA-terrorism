# EDA-terrorism
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for terrorism data involves loading and understanding the dataset's structure and statistics. It employs data visualization to uncover patterns and trends, including temporal and geospatial analysis. 
these are the general steps:

1. **Load the Data**: Begin by loading the terrorism dataset into your chosen data analysis environment. Common formats for terrorism datasets include CSV, Excel, or databases.

2. **Understand the Data Structure**:
   - Examine the first few rows of the dataset to get a sense of what the data looks like.
   - Check the data types of each column (e.g., numeric, categorical).
   - Determine the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
   - Identify any missing values in the dataset.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numeric columns.
   - Generate summary statistics for categorical columns, including counts and unique values.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to better understand the data. Common plots include histograms, box plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and time series plots.
   - Visualize the distribution of key variables, such as the number of terrorist incidents over time, by region, or by attack type.
   - Explore trends and patterns in the data through visualizations.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features or transform existing ones that might be useful for analysis. For example, you can derive a new variable for the severity of attacks based on casualties.
   
6. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - Analyze how terrorism incidents have changed over time, looking for trends and spikes in activity.
   - Examine the seasonality of attacks, if applicable.

7. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - If the dataset includes geographic information, use geospatial visualizations to explore the distribution of incidents on a map.
   - Identify hotspots or regions with higher terrorism activity.

8. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Explore correlations between variables. For instance, you can examine whether there's a correlation between the number of attacks and the severity of those attacks.

9. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Formulate hypotheses related to the data (e.g., "Are terrorist incidents more frequent in certain regions?"). Conduct statistical tests to investigate these hypotheses.

10. **Outlier Detection**:
    - Identify and analyze outliers, which could represent unusual or extreme events.

11. **Conclusions and Insights**:
    - Summarize your findings and insights from the analysis.
    - Highlight any actionable information or patterns that emerge from the data.
